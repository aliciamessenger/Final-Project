                <p>*INSERT PODCAST HERE*</P>

                <P>This podcast shows the T part of the VT Shaped Student because it's about an English major who learns how to do HTML and begins to hack NASA. The student has expertise in creative writing. She thinks she only needs to learn about the writing side of it. But, we see that she learns that understanding how to do things in technology are greatly beneficial. She ends up getting an internship where she can further use her skills. Having both kinds of skills, technological and liberal arts, make her more interesting to employers. It also exposes her to a field of study she never would have considered had she not been forced to take a class about it. She found a new interest. I think that's an important part of the VT Shaped Student. You learn skills that make you more attractive to employers. But you also have the opportunity to discover new kinds of fields that you might not have found otherwise. </p>
