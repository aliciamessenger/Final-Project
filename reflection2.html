                    <p>The VT Shaped Student model is definitely an interesting way of looking at education. I think it’s important to have a wide array of skills, especially in this day and age where everything is connected. Also, as someone who isn’t sure of what they want to do in the future, it’s nice that there’s an emphasis on exploring other options and learning different things instead of having one main focus.</p>

                    <p>It gives students a chance to discover new interests while still completing courses that are required for a degree. It’s also intriguing because I feel like for the most of my education, there has been a sense of urgency to quickly find one topic and make it the focus of one’s education. There wasn’t much encouragement to broaden one’s horizons. So I’m glad that educators are trying out the VT Shaped Student model so students can become well rounded and discover new passions.</p>

                    <p>However, in my opinion, there’s a possibility that some students may fall through the cracks with this model. When it comes to implementing new curricula, I think educators and administrators have good intentions. But, I believe it’s easy for them to get wrapped up in trying to make sure their programs succeed that they forget about the students who are not being helped.</p>

                    <p>I think there are a lot of good things about the model, but I also think a lot of people may have difficulty adapting to it. Those are the people who are going to need the most help. If administrators and educators really want the VT Shaped Student model to be a success, they’re going to need to make sure they are working to enable students to get the most out of the program and be the best they can be, and not working for the success of their program.</p>


                    <p>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed working in HTML. Before this class, I thought digital writing was extremely complicated and only computer geniuses were able to create things using HTML. When we first started learning HTML, it seemed like a very daunting task, especially because I wouldn’t consider myself to be a computer genius. But, after learning the basics and slowly adding on to them, I realize it’s not that complicated. At least, not at my current level. It reminds me of solving for X in algebra. There are steps you must take in order to reach the end result. The steps all add on one another, so once you understand one step, the next step isn’t that difficult to learn. It's definitely something anyone can do, once you learn the basics.</p>

                    <p>However, for me, my problem with HTML is <em>remembering</em> the steps. I’ll know how to start something, but I frequently get confused trying to remember what the next step is. I also need to remember which code to use for which thing, because a lot of times I know what I want to do but I’m not sure the exact code that will enable me to do it.</p>
